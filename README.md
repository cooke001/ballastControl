# ballastControl
This is the software for an Arduino Uno to use to control the Ballast unit as part of the UnderGRND Project.
The arduino uses the Arduino Motor Driver Sheild, along with a custom hat with buttons and a Molex header to connect a limit switch to.

Work has been started on rewriting this code for an STM32 board (ARM) in anticipation of its integration with the rest of the system.
