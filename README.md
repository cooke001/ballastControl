# ballastControl
This is the software for an Arduino Uno to use to control the Ballast unit as part of the UnderGRND Project.
The arduino uses the Arduino Motor Driver Sheild, along with a custom hat with buttons and a Molex header to connect a limit switch to.

Other modules for control and datalogging have been implemented using the ESP8266 chip.

I'll finish this readme eventually...
